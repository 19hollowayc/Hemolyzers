## What are Hemolyzers?

Hemolyzers are lab machines that are used to anaylyze a patient's blood to check for numerous diseases.

### How does it relate to our device?

Our device allows an interface where doctors can check a patient's blood sample wirelessly wherever they are. Doctors are notified when there is an issue for example hypercoagulation. This will be able to save many COVID-19 patients'lives and make doctor's worklife balance better.
